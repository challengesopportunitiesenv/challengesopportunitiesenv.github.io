	<p class="large text-muted">This workshop brings together experts on environmental governance, socio-ecological systems, social movements, and social networks. Our primary objectives are to identify new connections between these fields, promote international comparative approaches, and facilitate new collaborative relationships around the substantive areas of climate change, resource extraction, and nature-oriented tourism.</p>
	<p class="large text-muted">The workshop will take place over two days. The first day will provide context for the policy process and knowledge mobilization questions on the second day. We will focus on two modes of development in North Atlantic regions: offshore oil and nature tourism. Much of the time, these sectors do not appear to intersect and are not incorporated into the same discussions about the social and ecological viability of coastal communities in the North Atlantic, including in Atlantic Canada, Norway, Iceland, Denmark and Scotland. However, the problem of climate change and a potentially binding international carbon budget may lead decision makers to revisit these modes of development. Contributors will examine the relationship between levels of engagement and deliberation among key actors in the environmental governance of these sectors -- including social movements and media -- and will emphasize agenda setting, environmental performance, and social-ecological sustainability.</p>
	<p class="large text-muted">Workshop sessions on the second day will focus on knowledge and policy networks, in particular networks connecting governments, industry, scientists, think tanks, social movement organizations, and other citizen groups around the issues of climate change, resource extraction, and nature-oriented tourism. Key issues include (1) how political systems enable or constrain transnational environmental governance, (2) the tensions between local, national, and transnational development and environmental policy making, (3) the effects of international differences in environmental “knowledge regimes” and science-policy networks, and finally (4) the role of consulting, decision support, and decision making methodologies in environmental policy making.</p>
